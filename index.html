    <h1>A Game Of Risk</h1>
    <p>We all want to win the prize, but how much risk will you take to succeed?</p>
  </header>
  
  <section class="rules">
    <p>Click for rules and conditions</p>
    <p>You will get 3 attempts to grab the treasure from within the chest. On every occasion, the closer you get to the treasure, the closer you get to peril. You can withdraw your hand from the treasure chest at any point, but the less far you reach in, the less you will be able to get hold of. The further you reach, the more you'll be able to grab hold of, but the greater the chance that you'll reach too far and lose it all! (Tip... Reaching in to a depth of 6 is always too far).

      Press the up arrow to go further, press the down arrow to withdraw your hand completely.
